Version 1.2:

verhaul of adjacent algorithm, now for each (i,j) there is a limited list of
helices up to certain number (default 11, can be set with -l). This reduces
the complexity to n^4 (time), resp. n^2 (memory). Also added option to search
only the pseudoknots above given length (-m).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
|>|>|> INSTALL:

WARNING:
Before the installation, make sure you have the last version of ViennaRNA
library installed!

- clone directory
- cd Pknotfind
- make

|>|>|> Running:
- ./PknotFind -i name_of_input_file -p num_samples

The default number of samples is 100.

Other options:
-j: skew for helices (default 2)
-k: energy penalty (default 900)
-l: length of list+1 (default 11)
-m: minimum pk length (default 6)
